 ## CURRENT RELEASE

The [latest version of AutoPrimer3](https://github.com/david-a-parry/autoprimer3/releases/latest) fixes issues arising from UCSC's recent update to their genome metadata that stopped previous versions from working. It also gives the option to specify names for targets when designing to regions/coordinates.

# AutoPrimer3

AutoPrimer3 retrieves gene information, DNA sequences and SNP information from the [UCSC genome browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/) and uses [primer3](http://primer3.sourceforge.net/) to automatically design primers to genes or genomic coordinate targets. 

Primers may be designed using information from any of the UCSC hosted genomes and primers can be made to avoid overlapping SNPs for genomes where SNP databases are available. 

An instructions PDF can be viewed by selecting the 'Help' menu item from the application or by visiting [here](https://github.com/gantzgraf/autoprimer3/blob/master/src/com/github/autoprimer3/instructions.pdf).
