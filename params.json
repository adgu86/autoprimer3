{"name":"Autoprimer3","tagline":"A program to automatically generate primer designs to genes and genomic coordinates using primer3","body":"#AutoPrimer3\r\n\r\nAutoPrimer3 retrieves gene information, DNA sequences and SNP information from the [UCSC genome browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/) and uses [primer3](http://primer3.sourceforge.net/) to automatically design primers to genes or genomic coordinate targets. \r\n\r\nPrimers may be designed using information from any of the UCSC hosted genomes and primers can be made to avoid overlapping SNPs for genomes where SNP databases are available. \r\n\r\nAn instructions PDF can be viewed by selecting the 'Help' menu item from the application or by visiting [here](https://github.com/gantzgraf/autoprimer3/blob/master/src/com/github/autoprimer3/instructions.pdf).\r\n\r\n##CREDIT\r\n\r\nAutoPrimer3 was written by David A.
